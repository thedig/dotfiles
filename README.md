# z's dotfiles source control

## Installation

### How to use this repo

Fork and clone this repository.

```
cd dotfiles
```

* Open up `makesymlinks.sh` in your text editor, and add the names of all dotfiles you want to track in the `files` variable.
* Edit/replace the files in this repo to match your own pre-existing dotfiles.
* The `makesymlinks.sh` script will then back up all of your dotfiles into a directory called `old_dotfiles`, and create symlinks in your home directory pointing to the dotfiles in this repo:

```
./makesymlinks.sh
```

You can now use Git to track these files.

**Note:** The global gitconfig file is in it's own directory so as not to conflict with the gitconfig file for this particular repository. Make sure you change the user settings in this file to match your own!

## Further details

### This profile installs `z`
A command line directory jumper, [more info here](https://github.com/rupa/z).

### Specify the `$PATH`

If `~/.path` exists, it will be sourced along with the other files, before any feature testing (such as [detecting which version of `ls` is being used](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles/blob/aff769fd75225d8f2e481185a71d5e05b76002dc/.aliases#L21-26)) takes place.

Here’s an example `~/.path` file that adds `~/utils` to the `$PATH`:

```bash
export PATH="$HOME/utils:$PATH"
```

### Add custom commands without creating a new fork

If `~/.extra` exists, it will be sourced along with the other files. You can use this to add a few custom commands without the need to fork this entire repository, or to add commands you don’t want to commit to a public repository.

You could also use `~/.extra` to override settings, functions and aliases from my dotfiles repository. It’s probably better to [fork this repository](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles/fork) instead, though.

## Setting up a new Mac:
Use these dotfiles to set up a fresh environment.

### Sensible OS X defaults

When setting up a new Mac, you may want to set some sensible OS X defaults:

*Warning: this will make a lot of changes to your environment. It's a good idea to customize this file to your liking.*

```bash
./.osx
```

### Install Homebrew formulae

When setting up a new Mac, you may want to install some common [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) formulae (after installing Homebrew, of course):

```bash
brew bundle ~/Brewfile
```

### Install native apps with `brew cask`

You could also install native apps with [`brew cask`](https://github.com/phinze/homebrew-cask):

```bash
./.cask
```
